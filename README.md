# The application structure
The VulkanTriangleApplication project is divided in two main folders which are "TriangleApplication" and "Shaders". 
Under the "TriangleApplication" folder you will find the "Application.h" and "Application.cpp" files that contain the declaration and implementation of the "Application" class.
